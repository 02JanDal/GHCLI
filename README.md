# GHCLI

GHCLI is a command line full screen client for Github (mainly issues). While not written using it, it's functionality is similar to what would have been achieved with (N)curses.

## Installation

Just run:

    $ gem install ghcli

## Usage

    $ ghcli

On first run you will be prompted for your Github username and password. Once you are in, try running `show #1`, `update` or `web #1`.

## TODO

* Use ncurses
* Managing issues
* Multi-column view
* Searching for issues

## Contributing

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request
